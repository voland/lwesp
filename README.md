# Lightweight ESP-AT parser my branch with just added support for stm32f4xx with std_peripheral_library

LwESP is lightweight ESP AT commands parser library to communicate with ESP8266 or ESP32 Wi-Fi module using AT commands. Module is written in C99 and is independent from used platform. Its main targets are embedded system devices like ARM Cortex-M, AVR, PIC and others, but can easily work under `Windows`, `Linux` or `MAC` environments.

`esp-at-lib` is a library for host device (MCU as an example) which drives ESP32 or ESP8266 devices running official `AT commands` firmware written and maintained by Espressif System.
Source of official firmware is publicly available at [esp32-at](https://github.com/espressif/esp-at) repository.

If you are only interested in using module and not writing firmware for it, you may download pre-build AT firmware from [Espressif systems download section](https://www.espressif.com/en/support/download/at) and focus only on firmware development on host side, for which you need the library posted here.

Follow documentation for more information on implementation and details.
